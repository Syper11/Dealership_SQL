# There is a bus moving in the city, and it loads and drops some people at each bus stop.
# You are provided with a list (or array)of lists of integer pairs. Elements of each pair represent 
# number of people get into bus (The first item) and number of people get off the bus (The second item) in a bus stop.
# Your task is to return number of people who are still in the bus after the last bus station (after the last array). 
# Even though it is the last bus stop, the bus is not empty and some people are still in the bus, and they are probably sleeping there :D

# Take a look on the test cases.
